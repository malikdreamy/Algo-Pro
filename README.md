# Algo-Pro
Algorithm Pro

## Description

An advanced AI powered programming Algorithm Challenger. On the challenge page you can test your skills at writing algorithms in three different programming languages, Javascript, Python, and C++. If you are having trouble answering the question the AI can solve it for you  and explain how it solved the question. You can also save the questions and the responses in your account as a user or you can download the file as a txt file to study them later.

CHALLENGE PAGE:

On the challenge page inside of the black nav bar you can select which programming language you want the challenge question in, you must select a difficulty level and then finally select which concept you want to be tested in. Once you press the get question button the challenge will be displayed in the white question box. You will then use the code editor at the bottom to type your solution. After typing you will need to press submit your code in order for the AI to check you reponse. It will then respond accordingly. If you do not understand how to solve it you can select the 'Get Solution' button and the solved result will be printed to the code editor.
